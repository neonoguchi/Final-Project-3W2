# Playable RPG

## Repository
<https://github.com/neonoguchi/Final-Project-3W2>

## Description
This project will allow the user to play as a dot and play through a basic rpg styled level.

## Features
- Playable Avatar
	- Implement WASD to allow the character to move around freely.
- Interactables
	- Have items and locations using 'if' statements to see if they are interactable or not.
- Display feedback
	- Create text for each possible in-game action, and display the text for a limited amount of time.
- Character Life/ Hazards
    - There will be hitboxes that can cause the player to lose.

## Challenges
- Learning how to create a moveable character that can run freely on display.
- Potentially on how to make multiple levels (Once one level is cleared, it continues to the next level).
- Randomly generated world with hazards

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- 2 Levels
    Level 1: Basic Level
        Includes:
        - A moveable character
        - A 'Key' item
        - A locked door that will tell you its locked when trying to interact with it without the key.
        - Door unlocks after collecting key first.
        NEXT LEVEL
    Level 2: Hazard Level
        Includes:
        - Every feature from Level 1
        - Hazardous models that cause GAME OVER when touched
        - Hazardous models also move (on either fixed paths or randomly generate paths)

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Having a moveable character is the main goal of this project for me.
